## Description

In this project, the challenge of detecting objects from new categories without fine-tuning and in conditions of minimal labeled data was addressed.

To tackle this, a simple yet effective model architecture was proposed. It comprises two main components â€” a fully convolutional neural network extracting feature descriptions and a transformer-based model associating information from several annotated examples with the extracted representations for making predictions.

The proposed model leverages information from multiple annotated examples and performs one-stage detection. The model was trained and evaluated both on a custom synthetic dataset and FSOD dataset.
